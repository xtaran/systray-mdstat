systray-mdstat (1.1.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * TODO: New minor upstream release with only documentation changes.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to 10.
    + Update versioned debhelper build-dependency accordingly.
  * Set "Rules-Requires-Root: no".
    + Skip dh_strip_nondeterminism. Currently doesn't work well with R³
      and is not needed for this package anyways. Thanks to Niels Thykier
      for pointing out the latter.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.1.1.
    + Change priority from extra to optional. (Actually already a
      requirement of 4.1.0.)
