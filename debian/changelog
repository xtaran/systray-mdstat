systray-mdstat (1.2.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix and feature release
    + Uses Desktop::Notify (libdesktop-notify-perl) for notifications.
      (Hopefully closes: #886419)
    + Fixes false negative issue when multiple disks failed in a RAID.
    + Notify when the state of any RAID changes, not just the overall
      state.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to 13.
    + Build-depend on "debhelper-compat (= 13)" to replace debian/compat.
  * Set "Rules-Requires-Root: no".
    + Build-Conflict with dh-strip-nondeterminism < 0.040~ to ensure
      proper "R³: no" support.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.5.0.
    + Change priority from extra to optional. (Actually already a
      requirement of 4.1.0.)
  * Apply "wrap-and-sort -a".
  * Check for DEB_BUILD_PROFILES in override_dh_auto_test.
  * Add DEP12 debian/upstream/metadata file.
  * Follow package renaming and suggest wmdocker instead of docker.
  * Update copyright years in debian/copyright.
  * Enable autopkgtests by creating a minimal debian/tests/control file.
