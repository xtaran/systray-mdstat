systray-mdstat TODO
===================

* Notifications must not disappear automatically themselves but must
  be confirmed.
* Sometimes notifcations are truncated, which is bad.
* Right-click menu: maybe add an "About" entry. (And maybe also an
  "cat /proc/mdstat" entry.)
* Maybe make configurable if check or verify should cause a warning.
