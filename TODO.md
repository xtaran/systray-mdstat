systray-mdstat TODO
===================

* Sometimes notifcations are truncated, which is bad.
* Left-click menu: maybe add an "cat /proc/mdstat" entry
* Maybe make configurable if check or verify should cause a warning.
* Maybe show time stamps in notifications.
* Maybe show recovery/check progress in notification. (Can
  notifications be updated?)
