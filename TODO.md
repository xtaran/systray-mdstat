systray-mdstat TODO
===================

* Notifications must not disappear automatically themselves but must
  be confirmed.
* Sometimes notifcations are truncated, which is bad.
* Left-click menu: maybe add an "cat /proc/mdstat" entry
* Maybe make configurable if check or verify should cause a warning.
