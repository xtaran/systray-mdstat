systray-mdstat TODO
===================

* Notifications must not disappear automatically themselves but must
  be confirmed.
* Sometimes notifcations are truncated, which is bad.
* Should have a right-click menu with at least a "Quit" entry and
  maybe an "About" entry. (And maybe also an "cat /proc/mdstat"
  entry.)
* Maybe make configurable if check or verify should cause a warning.
